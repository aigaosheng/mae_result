For LLM based summarization task, have not chatGPT account. Thus the only soluion is to use open-source Llama 2, which model is too big to run in cpu labtop.

Solutions:
1. GPT-4 turbo: can call API to do summarization (no account), which support PDF as input
+ Prompt GPT4 to do summarization for 2 PDFs
+ Prompt GPT4 to compare 2 summarized documents.

2. Using Llama or Bart models hosted in Huggingface. There are many resources, e.g.

+ https://huggingface.co/spaces/pszemraj/document-summarization

++ For above 3rd-party packages, input is text. Thus, PDF is first needed to converted to text, which can be done using 3rd-party toolkits, e.g. https://github.com/shahrukhx01/multilingual-pdf2text
+++ The extracted text from PDFs refers to :
    -- Swiss-Dormant-Assets.txt
    -- UK-Dormant-Assets.txt

++ Summarization using free online service:

This paper is a copyrighted version of the original account book, which was published in England in March of 2008. It contains all of the changes that have been made to the bank and building societies accounts since the Act was first passed. It also includes a new section on how financial institutions are supposed to make those who are not entitled to their accounts aware of how much money they have transferred and how quickly they have been able to pay back their owes. The government has asked HM Treasury for a full, in-depth review of the dorment account scheme, including how many banks, building societies and other financial institutions have reclaimed money. In addition, the government has proposed an alternative scheme that would allow smaller banks and buildings societies to transfer their balances to a "reclaim fund" instead of transferring them directly to the big lottery fund. The Government believes that the alternative scheme is not likely to be adopted because of the limited amount of money that the government needs to pass on to the reclaim funds. However, it does have some technical reasons for not having any participants in the scheme at present. For example, the proportion of money needed to be passed on to Reclaim Fundland to meet'reclaims' limits, the cost of joining the scheme, and the fact that there is no way for small banks or building society to transfer money directly to local charities. Finally, the Government decides to undertake further reviews of the alternative plan in three years.

+++ Swiss summary

his factsheet is a summary of the latest developments in the Swiss banking system. The Swiss Banking Association has adopted new rules and regulations regarding the treatment of all assets held at banks without any contact or dorment. In cases where no contact is made between a client and the bank, the assets will be published on the Swiss Banks Association's web site. For example, if a claimant loses contact with the bank within one year, it will transfer the entire amount of the claimant's account to the Federal Government. If this transfer takes place after 60 years, the claims are null and cannot be repaid. To prevent this from happening, the Board of directors has drawn up a series of recommendations for banks to follow in cases where their clients' accounts are lost or their assets are dormanted.
